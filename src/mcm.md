# MCP Context Manager (MCM)

**Automated MCP discovery, optimization, and intelligent context management for Claude Code**

---

## 🎯 What MCM Does (In Plain English)

You know how MCPs eat up your context window? Each MCP you add can consume 5-10% of your available tokens before you even start working. Stack 3-4 MCPs and you've lost 20-30% of your context to tool definitions you're not even using.

**MCM solves this automatically:**

1. **Discovers** your MCPs from any format (names, URLs, repos, your Claude config)
2. **Analyzes** what each MCP does using AI + web scraping
3. **Converts** them to optimal formats that save 90-95% context
4. **Loads** only the exact tools you need, when you need them
5. **Learns** your patterns and gets smarter over time

**Bottom line:** After a 3-minute setup, you never think about MCPs again. Just use Claude Code normally and MCM handles everything invisibly in the background.

## 🚀 First-Time Setup (Do This Once)

### Step 1: Run Discovery

```
/mcm discover
```

MCM will prompt you with three options:

```
🔍 Ready to discover your MCPs!

How would you like to provide them?
1. Paste a list (names, URLs, or mixed)
2. Point to a file
3. Scan my Claude config automatically

Choose 1-3:
```

### Step 2: Provide Your MCPs

**Choose Option 1** if you have a list. MCM accepts ANY of these formats:

```
✅ Just names:
filesystem
github
postgres
playwright

✅ NPM packages:
@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres

✅ GitHub URLs:
https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts

✅ Mixed (all at once):
filesystem
@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
https://github.com/user/custom-mcp
playwright
slack

✅ Even descriptions:
"the postgres database MCP"
"GitHub integration server"
"that MCP for browser automation"
```

MCM is smart enough to figure out what you mean.

**Choose Option 2** to point to a file:
```
Path to file: ~/my-mcps.txt
```

**Choose Option 3** to auto-scan:
```
MCM: Scanning ~/.config/claude/mcp_config.json...
Found 8 MCPs. Proceed with discovery? (y/n)
```

### Step 3: Wait for Discovery (2-5 minutes)

MCM shows live progress:

```
🚀 Discovering 6 MCPs...

Progress:

What's happening:
• Fetching docs from GitHub, npm, and Exa.ai
• Extracting tool definitions from source code
• Testing each tool in sandbox
• Determining optimal conversion format
• Generating tests and validation suites

Detailed logs: ~/.mcm/logs/discovery.log
```

### Step 4: Review Results

```
✅ Discovery Complete!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Total MCPs Discovered:      6
Total Tools Available:      42
Context Saved:              ~18,500 tokens (92% reduction)
Estimated Setup Cost:       ~$0.35 in API calls
Estimated Daily Savings:    ~$0.12 in context costs

FORMAT BREAKDOWN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Progressive Disclosure (3 MCPs):
  ✓ github          15 tools → individual scripts
  ✓ slack            8 tools → individual scripts
  ✓ aws             12 tools → individual scripts

  Why: These MCPs have many tools (10+). Converting to
       individual scripts allows loading only what you need.
  Context: 500-800 tokens per MCP (vs 5,000-8,000 before)

CLI Wrapper (2 MCPs):
  ✓ filesystem       4 tools → unified CLI
  ✓ eslint           3 tools → unified CLI

  Why: Simple MCPs with few tools. CLI is cleaner.
  Context: 200-400 tokens per MCP (vs 2,000-3,000 before)

Skill Bundle (1 MCP):
  ✓ postgres         7 tools → database-ops skill

  Why: Related tools often used together in workflows.
  Context: 600 tokens (vs 4,500 before)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  ACTION REQUIRED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Missing Credentials:
  • github:   GITHUB_TOKEN (for API access)
  • postgres: DATABASE_URL (connection string)
  • slack:    SLACK_TOKEN (workspace access)

I've created: ~/.mcm/config/credentials.env

Please fill in your credentials, then run: /mcm validate

⚡ Quick Start:
  Already have credentials in .env? Run: /mcm import-env
  Need help getting tokens? Run: /mcm help <mcp-name>
```

### Step 5: Add Credentials

MCM creates a template for you:

```bash
# Edit the file
code ~/.mcm/config/credentials.env
```

The file looks like this:

```bash
# GitHub MCP
# Get token: https://github.com/settings/tokens (needs repo, read:org)
GITHUB_TOKEN=

# Postgres MCP
# Format: postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
DATABASE_URL=

# Slack MCP
# Get token: https://api.slack.com/apps (create app → OAuth & Permissions)
SLACK_TOKEN=

# Optional: Exa.ai (for better MCP discovery in future)
# You already have this set up globally! ✓
# EXA_API_KEY=91965e99-9c35-45c3-995f-a130c508b687
```

**Already have a .env file?**

```bash
/mcm import-env ~/path/to/your/.env
```

MCM will extract relevant credentials automatically.

### Step 6: Validate Everything Works

```
/mcm validate
```

MCM tests each MCP:

```
🔍 Validating 6 MCPs...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ filesystem
   • All 4 tools validated
   • No credentials needed
   • Tests passed: 12/12

✅ github
   • All 15 tools validated
   • GITHUB_TOKEN verified ✓
   • API rate limit: 4,982/5,000 remaining
   • Tests passed: 45/45

✅ postgres
   • All 7 tools validated
   • DATABASE_URL connected ✓
   • Database: twentyfive_crm (Neon Postgres)
   • Tests passed: 21/21

✅ eslint
   • All 3 tools validated
   • Auto-detected project config ✓
   • Tests passed: 9/9

⚠️  slack
   • 7/8 tools validated
   • SLACK_TOKEN verified ✓
   • Warning: slack_upload_file failed (permissions issue)
   • Fix: Add files:write scope to your Slack app
   • Tests passed: 19/21

✅ playwright
   • Already validated previously ✓

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✅ 5/6 MCPs fully validated
⚠️  1/6 MCPs have warnings (non-critical)

Total tests run: 107
Passed: 105
Failed: 2 (both in slack - permission issues)

🎉 MCM is ready to use!

Run /mcm status to see current state
Or just start using Claude Code - MCM runs automatically!
```

### Step 7: You're Done! 🎉

**That's it.** From now on, just use Claude Code normally. MCM automatically:
- Monitors your conversation
- Detects what tools you need
- Loads them on-demand
- Unloads stale tools
- Manages context budget

You never have to think about MCPs again.

---

## 💬 How It Works (Daily Usage)

After setup, **you do nothing**. MCM works invisibly. Here's what actually happens:

### Example 1: GitHub Workflow

```
You: "Show me all open PRs that touch the authentication files"

[Behind the scenes - you don't see this:]
MCM: Detected intent → GitHub query + file search
MCM: Loading github_list_prs (180 tokens)
MCM: Loading github_search_code (220 tokens)
MCM: Total context: 400 tokens (vs 8,000 if full GitHub MCP loaded)

Claude Code: [Uses the tools, shows you results]

────────────────────────────────────────
Found 3 open PRs:
1. #142 - Add 2FA support (touches auth/login.ts)
2. #138 - Fix session timeout (touches auth/session.ts)
3. #135 - OAuth refactor (touches auth/oauth.ts)
────────────────────────────────────────

You: "Let's review #142 in detail"

[Behind the scenes:]
MCM: Intent confirmed → keeping github tools loaded
MCM: Total context: still 400 tokens

Claude Code: [Shows PR details, code changes, etc.]
```

### Example 2: Switching Context

```
You: "Now check how many users are in the database"

[Behind the scenes:]
MCM: Detected context switch → database query
MCM: Unloading github_search_code (no longer needed)
MCM: Loading postgres_query (190 tokens)
MCM: Total context: 370 tokens (400 - 220 + 190)

Claude Code: [Queries database]

────────────────────────────────────────
Database: twentyfive_crm
Query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
Result: 1,247 users
────────────────────────────────────────

You: "Show me users created in the last 30 days"

[Behind the scenes:]
MCM: Same intent → keeping postgres_query loaded
MCM: Total context: unchanged (370 tokens)

Claude Code: [Runs query, shows results]
```

### Example 3: Multi-Tool Workflow

```
You: "I need to create a new feature branch, update the schema, and open a PR"

[Behind the scenes:]
MCM: Detected complex workflow → multiple tool categories
MCM: Loading github_create_branch (150 tokens)
MCM: Loading filesystem_write (120 tokens)
MCM: Loading github_create_pr (180 tokens)
MCM: Loading postgres_migrate (200 tokens)
MCM: Total context: 650 tokens (vs 20,000+ if all MCPs loaded)

Claude Code: [Guides you through the workflow using all tools]
```

**Key Point:** Even when MCM loads 4 tools for a complex workflow (650 tokens), that's still **97% less context** than loading all your MCPs traditionally (20,000+ tokens).

---

## 📊 Understanding Context Savings

Let's break down the math with a real example:

### Traditional MCP Approach

```
Your MCPs:
  • filesystem (4 tools)    → 2,500 tokens
  • github (15 tools)       → 8,200 tokens
  • postgres (7 tools)      → 4,500 tokens
  • slack (8 tools)         → 3,800 tokens
  • eslint (3 tools)        → 1,200 tokens
  • playwright (12 tools)   → 6,500 tokens

Total baseline context: 26,700 tokens (13% of 200K window)

ALWAYS loaded: All 49 tools
Context available for actual work: 173,300 tokens (87%)
```

### MCM Approach

```
Baseline (MCM index only):
  • Tool index              → 1,200 tokens
  • Runtime monitoring      → 800 tokens

Total baseline context: 2,000 tokens (1% of 200K window)

Loaded on-demand: 2-5 tools at a time (300-800 tokens)
Peak context usage: ~2,800 tokens (1.4% of window)

Context available for actual work: 197,200 tokens (98.6%)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Context Saved: 23,900 tokens (90% reduction)
Additional Work Capacity: +23,900 tokens
Financial Savings: ~$0.12/day (~$3.60/month)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Real-world impact:**
- **Before MCM:** Out of context after 8-10 complex tasks
- **After MCM:** Can handle 30-40 complex tasks before hitting limits
- **4x more productive** in a single session

  • github_create_branch + filesystem_write + github_create_pr (18 times)
  • postgres_query + postgres_execute (14 times)
  • eslint_check_file + filesystem_write (11 times)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Create workflow skill: "new-feature-workflow"

   You frequently use this sequence:
   • github_create_branch
   • filesystem_write
   • github_create_pr

   I can bundle these into a single workflow skill that:
   • Reduces 3 tool loads → 1 skill load
   • Saves ~400 tokens per use
   • 18 uses = 7,200 tokens saved

   Create this workflow? (y/n)

2. Consider removing: slack MCP

   Usage: Only 4 tools used in last 30 days
   Context cost: 3,800 tokens baseline
   Potential savings: 3,800 tokens

   Alternative: Keep only frequently used slack tools
   • Keep: slack_send_message (Progressive Disclosure)
   • Remove: 7 other slack tools

   This would reduce slack from 3,800 → 300 tokens (92% reduction)

   Apply optimization? (y/n)

3. Adjust confidence threshold

   Current: 0.7 (balanced)
   False positives: 2.7% (5/185 loads)
   False negatives: 0% (0 missed loads)

   Your usage suggests you prefer conservative loading.
   Recommended: Increase to 0.75 (reduce false positives by ~50%)

   Trade-off: May need to manually load tools 1-2% more often

   Apply? (y/n)

4. Convert github to Skill Bundle

   Current format: Progressive Disclosure

   Analysis shows you use github tools in predictable workflows:
   • PR workflow (create branch → write → create PR)
   • Review workflow (list PRs → read PR → comment)
   • Issue workflow (list issues → create issue → update)

   Converting to 3 skill bundles would:
   • Make workflows more obvious
   • Reduce intent detection errors
   • Save ~200 tokens per workflow invocation

   Estimated savings: ~3,600 tokens/month

   Convert? (y/n)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💰 POTENTIAL SAVINGS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you apply all recommendations:
  • Context saved: ~11,600 tokens/month
  • Cost saved: ~$0.35/month
  • Workflow efficiency: +15%
  • Context headroom: +5.8%

```

#### Option 1: Context Management Strategy

```
You: 1

CONTEXT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current: Balanced (40% max tools, auto-unload after 3 msgs)

Choose strategy:

1. Conservative (20% max tools)
   • Minimal context usage
   • Aggressive auto-unloading (after 2 messages)
   • Best for: Long conversations, complex projects
   • Trade-off: May need manual loading more often

2. Balanced (40% max tools) ← CURRENT
   • Moderate context usage
   • Standard auto-unloading (after 3 messages)
   • Best for: Most use cases
   • Trade-off: Good balance of auto/manual

3. Aggressive (60% max tools)
   • Higher context usage
   • Relaxed auto-unloading (after 5 messages)
   • Best for: Short sessions, tool-heavy work
   • Trade-off: Less context for conversation

4. Custom
   • Set your own limits

Choose 1-4:
```

#### Option 2: Confidence Threshold

```
You: 2

AUTO-LOAD CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Current: 0.7 (balanced)

Your stats (last 30 days):
• False positives: 2.7% (loaded tools you didn't use)
• False negatives: 0.4% (missed tools you needed)

Threshold options:

1. Strict (0.8)
   • Loads only when very certain
   • Reduces false positives by ~60%
   • May increase false negatives by ~5-10%
   • Best if: You prefer manual control

2. Balanced (0.7) ← CURRENT
   • Loads when reasonably certain
   • Good balance of precision/recall
   • Best for: Most users

3. Lenient (0.6)
   • Loads more aggressively
   • Reduces false negatives to near 0%
   • May increase false positives by ~50%
   • Best if: You want maximum automation

Enter threshold (0.5-0.9) or choose 1-3:
```

#### Option 3: Pinned MCPs

```
You: 3

ALWAYS-LOADED MCPs (PINNED):

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MCM commands not found

```bash
# Verify installation
ls -la ~/.claude/commands/mcm.md

# Reinstall if missing
curl -fsSL https://mcm.dev/install.sh | sh

# Or manually
git clone https://github.com/mcm/mcm.git ~/.mcm-installer
~/.mcm-installer/install.sh
```

### "Discovery failed for <mcp>"

```
Check logs:
  cat ~/.mcm/logs/discovery.log | grep "<mcp-name>"

Common causes:
  1. Network issues (can't reach GitHub/npm)
     → Retry: /mcm reload <mcp-name>

  2. Invalid MCP name/URL
     → Check spelling, try full GitHub URL

  3. Private repository (no access)
     → Ensure you have GITHUB_TOKEN with repo access

  4. Rate limit exceeded
     → Wait 1 hour or add GITHUB_TOKEN to credentials
```

### "Tool not auto-loading"

```
Debug steps:

1. Check if tool exists:
   /mcm search "<what the tool does>"

2. Check confidence threshold:
   /mcm config → option 2
   Try lowering to 0.6 temporarily

3. Check logs:
   tail -f ~/.mcm/logs/runtime.log
   (send your message again and watch for intent detection)

4. Manual load:
   /mcm search "<tool-name>"
   Select the tool to load it

5. Report pattern:
   If tool should have loaded, MCM learns from this.
   It will adjust confidence for similar intents.
```

### "Validation failed"

```
/mcm validate

If specific tool fails:

1. Check credentials:
   code ~/.mcm/config/credentials.env
   Ensure all tokens/URLs are correct

2. Check permissions:
   • GitHub token: needs 'repo', 'read:org' scopes
   • Slack token: needs appropriate bot scopes
   • Database: connection string format correct?

3. Test manually:
   cd ~/.mcm/converted/<mcp-name>/tools/
   python3 <tool-name>.py --help
   python3 <tool-name>.py --test

4. Check logs:
   cat ~/.mcm/logs/errors.log | tail -20

5. Force regeneration:
   /mcm reload <mcp-name>
```

### "Context window still filling up"

```
Investigate:

1. Check what's loaded:
   /mcm status

   If you see 10+ tools loaded:
   • Some tools may be pinned unnecessarily
   • Confidence threshold may be too low
   • Auto-unload may be disabled

2. Check pinned MCPs:
   /mcm config → option 3
   Unpin MCPs you don't always need

3. Adjust strategy:
   /mcm config → option 1
   Switch to "Conservative" strategy

4. Check for non-MCM context:
   The conversation itself uses context.
   MCM can't control this - it's your messages + Claude's responses.

5. View breakdown:
   /mcm status
   Look at "Context Window Breakdown" to see what's using space
```

### "Exa.ai errors during discovery"

```
MCM automatically falls back to web scraping if Exa.ai fails.

You'll see:
  ⚠️  Exa.ai rate limit reached, using web scraping fallback

This is normal and doesn't affect functionality.
Discovery may take slightly longer (30-60s per MCP).

To avoid:
  • Get Exa.ai Pro plan (higher rate limits)
  • Discover MCPs in smaller batches
  • Wait 1 hour between large discoveries
```

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Creating Custom Workflows

MCM can detect repeated patterns and suggest workflows, but you can also create them manually:

```
You: I want to create a workflow for deploying to production

MCM:
What tools does this workflow use? (comma-separated)

You: github_create_branch, filesystem_write, eslint_check_file, github_create_pr, slack_send_message

MCM:
✓ Found all tools

Workflow name: production-deployment

Description: Creates feature branch, runs linting, creates PR, notifies team

Create workflow? (y/n)

You: y

MCM:
✅ Created workflow skill at ~/.mcm/converted/skills/production-deployment/

Usage:
  Just mention "deploy to production" or "start deployment workflow"
  MCM will auto-load all 5 tools instantly.

Context cost: 800 tokens (vs 1,400 if loaded individually)
```

### Importing Existing .env Files

```
/mcm import-env ~/my-project/.env

Scanning .env file...

Found relevant credentials:
  ✓ GITHUB_TOKEN
  ✓ DATABASE_URL
  ✓ SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
  ⚠️  OPENAI_API_KEY (not used by any MCP)

Import matching credentials? (y/n)

You: y

✅ Imported 3 credentials to ~/.mcm/config/credentials.env

Run /mcm validate to test MCPs with new credentials
```

### Converting MCPs Between Formats

```
You: I want to convert github from Progressive Disclosure to CLI

/mcm config → option 4

MCM:
FORMAT CONVERSION:

Current MCPs and formats:
1. filesystem → CLI Wrapper
2. github → Progressive Disclosure ← SELECT TO CHANGE
3. postgres → Skill Bundle
4. slack → Progressive Disclosure
5. eslint → CLI Wrapper
6. playwright → Direct MCP

Enter number to convert:

You: 2

MCM:
Convert 'github' FROM Progressive Disclosure TO:

1. CLI Wrapper
   • All 17 tools in one CLI
   • Context: 580 → ~900 tokens
   • Best if: You use many github tools together frequently

2. Skill Bundle
   • Group into workflow skills
   • Context: 580 → ~600 tokens
   • Best if: You use github in predictable patterns

3. Direct MCP
   • Keep original MCP format
   • Context: 580 → ~8,200 tokens
   • Best if: Rarely use github, ok with context hit

Choose 1-3:

You: 2

MCM:
Converting to Skill Bundle...

Analyzing usage patterns to create skills...

Detected workflows:
  1. PR Workflow (create branch, write, create PR)
  2. Review Workflow (list PRs, read, comment)
  3. Issue Workflow (list issues, create, update)

Create 3 skills? (y/n/customize)

You: y

MCM:
✅ Converted github to 3 skill bundles:
   • ~/.mcm/converted/skills/github-pr-workflow/
   • ~/.mcm/converted/skills/github-review-workflow/
   • ~/.mcm/converted/skills/github-issue-workflow/

Context saved: 580 → 600 tokens (similar)
But tools now load faster in predictable workflows!

Test workflow? Try: "Let's create a new PR for the auth feature"
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run `/mcm status` when confused**
   See exactly what's loaded and why

2. **Run `/mcm optimize` monthly**
   Get personalized improvement suggestions

3. **Pin your most-used MCP**
   If you use one MCP in 80% of sessions, pin it

4. **Create workflows for repeated patterns**
   3+ tools used together? Make a workflow skill

5. **Start Conservative, adjust later**
   Begin with Conservative strategy, relax if too much manual loading

6. **Check logs when debugging**
   `tail -f ~/.mcm/logs/runtime.log` shows real-time decisions

7. **Use semantic search liberally**
   `/mcm search "capability"` is faster than remembering exact tool names

8. **Validate after credential changes**
   Always run `/mcm validate` after updating .env
